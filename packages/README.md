# CodeUChain: Universal Framework

**Code-U-Chain**: Where code is chained as links, middleware observes, and contexts flow seamlessly.

A universal framework for building modular processing pipelines. Each language implementation optimizes for its community's strengths, united by shared design principles.

## Packages
- `packages/python/`: Prototyping paradise—dynamic, ecosystem-rich, academic warmth.
- `packages/javascript/`: Interactive playground—event-driven, ubiquitous runtime.
- `packages/typescript/`: Type-safe interactive playground—compile-time guarantees with JavaScript's ubiquity.
- `packages/rust/`: Safety sanctuary—immutable, compile-time guarantees.
- `packages/go/`: Concurrency canvas—simple, parallel flows.

## Design Principles
Universal design guides us: Serve each ecosystem effectively, embrace platform strengths, maintain consistent patterns. Learn once, adapt everywhere.

## Getting Started
Clone and explore packages. Start with Python for prototyping bliss, JavaScript for universal reach, or TypeScript for type-safe development.
