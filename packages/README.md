# CodeUChain: Agape Monorepo

**Code-U-Chain**: Where code is chained as links, middleware observes, and contexts flow with love.

A fresh start with agape—selfless, unconditional design. Each language implementation optimizes for its community's heart, united by universal foundation.

## Packages
- `packages/python/`: Prototyping paradise—dynamic, ecosystem-rich, academic warmth.
- `packages/javascript/`: Interactive playground—event-driven, ubiquitous runtime.
- `packages/typescript/`: Type-safe interactive playground—compile-time guarantees with JavaScript's ubiquity.
- `packages/rust/`: Safety sanctuary—immutable, compile-time guarantees.
- `packages/go/`: Concurrency canvas—simple, parallel flows.

## Philosophy
Agape love guides us: Serve each ecosystem without bias, forgive differences, embrace strengths. Learn once, adapt everywhere.

## Getting Started
Clone and explore packages. Start with Python for prototyping bliss, JavaScript for universal reach, or TypeScript for type-safe development.
