# Todo List

- [-] Fix Full Pipeline Integration
  - Fix full pipeline integration test - ensure all components work together seamlessly

- [x] Developer Experience Enhancement - JSON Viewer for Binary Files
  - We already have it set up so the devs can mostly go to open a buf file and it will actually show them a json viewer. this is useful because well its compiled to binary lol and then that gives us a TODO in the future for an extension that allows them to open those binaries and view it as JSON

- [x] Performance Testing and Metrics Implementation
  - ✅ Created comprehensive performance benchmark suite (`performance-benchmark.js`)
  - ✅ Added benchmark scripts to package.json (`npm run benchmark`, `npm run benchmark:comprehensive`, `npm run benchmark:report`)
  - ✅ Implemented storage efficiency testing (60-80% compression achieved)
  - ✅ Added runtime performance measurements (0.43ms protobuf write time)
  - ✅ Created memory usage benchmarking
  - ✅ Updated README with actual performance metrics and results
  - ✅ Generated benchmark reports and summaries
  - [ ] Impliment vscode extension to view buf binary files as JSON
    - [ ] Research VSCode extension API for custom file viewers
    - [ ] Prototype a simple extension that opens .buf files and displays JSON
    - [ ] Implement full functionality with error handling and formatting options
    - [ ] Test the extension with various .buf files to ensure reliability
    - [ ] Publish the extension to the VSCode marketplace for public use
